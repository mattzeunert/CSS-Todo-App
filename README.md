# CSS Todo App

Basic todo app functionality without using JavaScript. Instead it uses
pre-rendered HTML, the ~ combinator, CSS counters, and
the :checked and :target pseudo selectors.

Styling based on [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).

## What works

- Add new todo item (up to 50 items)
- Mark items as done
- Delete items
- Filter items (done/not done)
- Show number of items left to do

## What doesn't work

- Persistence after page reload
- Mark all as done
- Create item by pressing enter
